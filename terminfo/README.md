# terminfo

Terminal emulation definitions for colors and such.

## usage

### installation

By default, the compiled termcap file will reside in your home directory. This is
fine until you switch users, such as `sudo vim /etc/fstab` -- unless you pass `-E`
to `sudo` -- or install the compiled termcap files to a system-accessible path, such as
the default prefix, `/usr/share/terminfo`.

`install.sh`
